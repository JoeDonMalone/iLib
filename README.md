## Description
- The goal was to implement a fully functional and user friendly MERN application which utilized the below technologies. It is a simple application, but displays competencies with back-end and front-end development. 

## Technologies:
  *  REACT
  *  axios
  *  bootstrap
  *  express
  *  mongoose

## Usage
 - Functional for the 'Volumes' of the Google Books API. I will perhaps imlement a feature that add directly to specific users 'google bookshelf' and create their own database, but it will be some time in the future.
